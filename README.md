# alzheimerBlinkLamp
A 40Hz Blinking LED lamp for Alzheimers.
This is a rewrite of the example script that makes 5 NeoPixels blink at 40Hz. 
I made this for a friend who is worried about their Grandmother, they found 
some research that shows 40Hz blinking light sources may help to stop or 
reverse alzheimers by stimulation of a special gland in the ocular nerve cluster.
I didn't do any of the research and I make no claim that this will do anything 
other than make a blinking light.
